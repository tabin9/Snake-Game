Hey there,
Just after learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I jumped onto building
this project. I found it interesting as a kid how the Snake Game worked.
Now after learning how to code, I just feel like it is easier to make a 
replica of the game and I wanted to challenge my learning.

What new concepts I learnt in this project? Challenges I faced:
1. How do I make it move without continuously growing, used 'unshift' method of arrays, to replace the 
   first segment with new head position then poping the last element.
2. How do I add the length to snake when it eats the food. Don't pop the last element when snake eats food.
3. Collision was relatively easy in regards to hitting the grid, slef-collision was kind of tricky, had to 
   check if the coordinates of the head (first segment) coincides with coordinates of any other segment.
4. Building a proper and precise HTML then styling it with proper display properties was also challenging, 
   helped me put my HTML CSS skills to test, and learn few new concepts.
5. The most challenging of all was to keep track of the corner cases, keeping track of all the created
   functions and the coordinates of the grid.

A great start to my journey with this project.
